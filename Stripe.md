Stripe Services

Financial Services Payment Processor 

Irish-American FinTech Company 

Founded 2009 by Patrick and John Collison 

Stipe is an Irish-American, dual-headquartered services and software company in California and Dublin. The e-commerce unicorn known as Stripe was founded by John and Patrick Collison in 2009. Side projects led Patrick to complain about the speed and difficulty of accepting payments on the web. After meeting with co-founders of PayPal, Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, the Collison brothers received a $2 million investment. The Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, was newly appointed to the Stripe board in February of 2021.  

Stripe aims to offer easier and faster payment processing software and application programming interfaces and mobile applications. With Stripe growing at enormous rates, it has now expanded to Southeast Asia, China, India, and Japan. By 2021, Stripe raised another $600 million with intentions of expanding their European headquarters. Before their Europe and Asia extension, they launched a platform called Atlas which helped user in the U.S. with new start-ups. While Stripe is providing card services as well as fraud and risk management to large tech companies, Stripe also has a point-of-sale service called Terminal. The “Terminal” advantage is a combination of Stripe as a service and a physical card reader. These readers include Verifone P400 and BBPOS Chipper 2X BT. When it comes to countries and currencies, Stipe can work with 42 countries and 135 currencies. PayPay on the other hand can connect with 200 countries but only 25 currencies. (illuminz.com/blog/stripe-vs-paypal) These two powerhouses are setting the stage for a worldwide battle of transactions.

Stripe has built a name for itself so much; they now have a publishing company named Stripe Press which has grown to support ideas for innovative businesses. In October of 2020, Stripe created an atmospheric carbon and capture service for businesses that were looking for such a service. They named it Stripe Climate. The importance of this carbon capture and storage (CCS) process is to round-up waste carbon dioxide (CO2), transport it to a storage site, and deposit it where it will no longer enter the atmosphere.   

The innovations Stripe has managed to introduce to the industry caused the company to grow from a $2 million seed round in 2011 to a $95 billion valuation in 2021. Millions of dollars have poured into Stripe with investors like Thrive Capital, General Catalyst, and Tiger Global Management. PayPal is another big-name company that has pushed to mirror Stripe in some ways. PayPal now offers digital wallets and loans as well as a newly named piece called PayPal Commerce with primarily focuses on POS payments through "PayPal Here". PayPal and Stripe are charging the same when it comes to online transactions at a 2.9% rate. The two companies both have support for invoicing and recurring billing. The biggest difference between the two is user friendliness. PayPal is the most user friendly but Stripe will favor the powerful developer. The all-in-one payment processor and payment geteway that Stripe offers can only be offered as a bundle there for never offered independently. Other competiors like Square have also dipped in the payment game with similar services and prices. However, Square is a brick-and-mortar businesses that made it's debut in 2009 with in-person payment options. Fast forward to 2016, Square is now matching Stripe with a online payment service.

Stripe in my opinion, should venture into real estate and home loans. The payment system is already in place for smaller countries to take advantage of a company that hands out loans a little easier than say a bank that needs income levels to be high. With a paycheck direct deposit, someone could move funds to payments though the transaction system with no hang-ups. The loan and payment would of course be arranged beforehand and agreed upon. The purpose of the direct deposit is to not only ensure payment but also keep the 2.9% fee flowing. Both companies are moving forward with their currencies and transactions, but PayPal has the lead in digital currencies. PayPal now offers digital currencies with no option to trade. In this case, we are looking at a buy, sell, or hold only. If someone like myself wanted to send my crypto to a friend, PayPal (for now) can not offer this service.
